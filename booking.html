            <p>Welcome to our wedding planning company's pricing page! We understand that planning a wedding can be overwhelming and stressful, which is why we offer a variety of packages to suit your specific needs and budget.

              Our most popular package is the Full-Service Planning package, which includes everything from venue selection and vendor management to wedding design and coordination on the day of the event. This package is perfect for couples who want a stress-free wedding planning experience and a professional to handle all the details. This is at a starting price of $3000 and will vary based on venue and guest size.
              
              
              For couples who have already secured their venue and vendors, we offer a Partial Planning package, which includes assistance with the remaining planning details such as timeline creation and guest accommodations.
              
              
             We understand that every couple is unique and we want to provide a personalized experience for each of our clients.
              
             
              Our pricing is transparent and we will work with you to create a package that fits within your budget. Contact us today to schedule a consultation and learn more about how we can help you plan your dream wedding!
